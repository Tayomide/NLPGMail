# NLPGMail
An attempt at integrating NLP and Language theories in a real-world scenario.

# Note
This is a one-day project I created to serve as a proof of concept of an idea I had earlier today in class.

# Background
"Genre refers to a conventional category of discourse based on large-scale typification of rhetorical action; as action, it acquires meaning from the situation and from the social context in which that situation arose" - Carolyn Miller.

Forms of genres can be seen all around us, from tags to labels. I believe the ability of a computer to understand us as a human could lead to the automation of most drudgery. This is my attempt to automate the labeling of emails, leading to an improved workflow, a more structured and tidy mail, a backing up of mail into folders, and much more without the need for manual labeling.

# Structure
- The ```server``` folder is my node.js server that deals with the cleaning up, chunking, and embedding of Gmail messages
- The ```Code.gs``` contains a function that works. Although it is a proof of concept. (I plan on adding more functions in the future, but you are welcome to fork or copy this code and create a pull request with your functions

# Plans for the future
This project is a step toward integrating NLP and language theory using existing technologies in the real world. I would love to see the extremes this project could be pushed to and hopefully collaborate with like-minded people.
1. Add more Google Scripts function.
2. Use a better embedding model based on the MTEB English leaderboard.
3. Test scripts in various real-world scenarios and see their performance.
4. Add documentation for anyone to use both scripts and server.
5. Fix future bugs.
